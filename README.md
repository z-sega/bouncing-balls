# bouncing-balls
## Project brief (from MDN)
Finished the bouncy ball demo! This is an extension of that project from MDN to assess if you know how to use objects in Javascript. 
This version is a little bit more interactive, users have been granted the ability to control an evil circle, which will eat the balls if it catches them. There is a counter to keep track of the number of balls left to capture.

Enjoy!
